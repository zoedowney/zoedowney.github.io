_Brokeback Mountain_ now has a worthy match in the arena of heart-scoring tales of lost love and lonesome cowboys. _Strange Way of Life_ is Pedro Almodóvar’s short Western romance of regret, located in the great American expanse. The often overplayed myth of the Old West feels refreshingly underdeveloped in this condensed 30-minute script; as credits showed up too soon, I was saddened that Almodóvar had not opted for a feature length project here.

_Strange Way_ sets up the reunion of two rogue gunmen who were once lovers, Jake and Silva (Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal), after 25 years of separation. In an attempt to shift to the ‘right’ side of the law, in the decades past Jake has shifted from desperado into sheriff and placed miles of desert between him and his ex. On cue, a yearning Silva rides into town angling to reminisce and rekindle the fire from ‘those 60 days’ that took place years ago. Remaining unconvincingly unshaken by Silva’s appearance, Jake is resistant to being sentimentally reeled in. But there’s a familiar longing seeping through his stoic facade. A flashback spliced between scenes tells us the couple indeed have much tenderness to recall. Only now, in the mature stages of life, there are other meddlesome stakes in play.

_Strange Way_ lies in a nearby but distinct camp alongside its lovelorn-movie-cowboy companions. Unlike _Brokeback_ this film withstands becoming completely misty-eyed out on the range. Likewise, its intensity doesn't veer into the disquiet of Jane Campion’s _Power of the Dog_. Settling in between emotional registers, Almodóvar wavers between a fixation on the nostalgia of lustful youth and later crimes of bitterness versus passion. I view the abrupt ending of _Strange Way of Life_ as a _to be continued…_ rather than a story cut short before an ending is wholly satisfied. But perhaps, like a love affair extinguished in prime heat, a premature curtain call is a signal of a good thing that cannot be expected to last.
