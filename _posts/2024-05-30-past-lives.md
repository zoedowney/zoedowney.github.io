Three strangers—a woman and two men—perch together at a dive bar in New York City. Onlookers, made known only by voice, imagine the perceived relationship between them. Sat in the middle, the woman gently drags her gaze upwards before fixing it on us. Her eyes are heavy with feelings that are yet to be defined.

In the 2020s, the virtual houses itself within real life as if it has always nested there. Likewise, the concept of making and affirming connections through the internet becomes less alien with each passing year. The potential for spontaneous [digital connection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxzBvqY5PP0&ab_channel=DaftPunk) is threaded into the tapestry of modern existence as naturally as pairs of eyes, gazing across from one another, meeting by chance on a train during one afternoon.

Celine Song’s _Past Lives_ rests on themes of attachment, connection and reconnection in an era in which the digital and physical have become inseparable. Song revitalises the well-worn narrative of re-establishing personal ties from previous eras of life, aligned with this online accessibility we now place ourselves in. It initially focuses on two of the aforementioned bar characters—childhood sweethearts Na Young and Hae Sung (Greta Lee and Teo Yoo—growing up in Seoul, whose paths diverge and reconverge over the course of 20 years. At its pivotal moment in adolescence, Na Young is uprooted and emigrates to the Americas, while Hae Sung continues along a conventional life road in South Korea. A small fish facing a bigger pool of life, Na Young—now known as Nora—grapples with her new immigrant status. But, as her mother consciously says: “When you leave something behind, you gain something, too.”

Song’s [theatrical](https://www.screendaily.com/features/celine-song-talks-moving-from-theatre-to-film-for-past-lives-you-have-to-accept-the-chaos-on-the-day/5188978.article) resumé influences her reliance on the implied tenet: ‘less is more’. Settings are sparse, dramatic signals subdued and drama: dialogue driven—this is a character study, at heart. If not for the clear and disparate cultural line drawn between New York and Seoul by the players, context would verge on irrelevant. After all, stories of romance and feeling orbit around relationships between people, not place. But, inevitably, location becomes the tense conflict glued to the ‘what if?’ at the centre of Nora and Hae Sung’s relationship as adults. After reconnecting during university years, they rekindle a modern-day [Kafka and Milena](https://kafkamuseum.cz/en/franz-kafka/women/milena-jesenska/) long-distance romance that exists purely online. Their wholesome reconnection—driven by a desire to relive fond childhood memory—cushions the disharmony of daily grown-up life for Hae Sung, and reminds Nora that roots previously laid down in her South Korean homeland were not as cleanly severed as she had imagined.

The crux of the film, held together by the 8,000-layer [in-yun](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EC%9D%B8%EC%97%B0) concept of providence and fate in relationships, is tested by the long-awaited introduction of the second man at the bar: Nora’s soon-to-be husband, Arthur. _Past Lives_ reveals its true sensitivity in its handling of Nora’s second major romance. Here, dramatic instinct met with the fate notion seeks to misdirect and encourage the demonisation of Arthur as interloper. Even Arthur self-characterises as the “evil white American husband”, obstructing the path to love’s destiny and the unification of Nora and Hae Sung. Doomed romances in dramatic terms require a fairytale aspect of kismet-meets-strife. However, in reality, emotional maturity recognises that lasting compatibility is built on mutual understanding and the consistent alignment of personal values. Despite complex romantic threads tied to Hae Sung—which may resist loosening—Nora and Arthur are fated to belong together precisely because they choose each other, _first_.

The dramatic success of _Past Lives_ is underscored by emotional complexities handled carefully in the manner of sincere adults; feelings gently held and thoughtfully considered. In Song’s world, physical touch is not the definitive point at which romantic attraction intersects. Instead, empathy holds a similar, if not higher value than the physical dimension of love. Indeed, the moving hug shared by Nora and Hae Sung when meeting for the first time since childhood—incidentally, their first [real-life contact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d4ObkmCJYs&t=7s&ab_channel=A24) as actors—exemplifies a lost significance that was once attributed to small gestures. In a time where cinema is hasty to throw characters into bed with one another, _Past Lives_ chooses to assign poignancy to a broader spectrum of human graces. It declares that meaning can be applied to actions and impulses of romance not merely satisfied by sexual conquest; even more so when building a foundational mutual respect and reciprocal emotional love that replace a necessity for immediate physical intimacy.

_Past Lives_ foregrounds a serious romance left unfulfilled. A vital dimension of intimacy is found in the space between its central couple when, in another feature, delicate moments might be unsoftened by the premature introduction of physicality. Rather, it is an emotional weight and heavy sense of ‘almost’ that initially dissatisfies, but ultimately supercedes the hope for a clear-cut, ‘happy’ ending. A delayed emotional pay-off instead becomes a life-affirming tribute to romantic sensibility. Forever bestowed is the ‘romantic’ epithet to film that moves beyond the desire for intimate closure to a sensitive understanding of the elaborate nature of love—in all its layers.
