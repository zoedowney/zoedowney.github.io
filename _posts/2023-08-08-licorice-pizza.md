Few films carry the label ‘laugh-out-loud’ and stand by that pledge. _Licorice Pizza_ is, verifiably, a riot. I may have seen it 17 times but an invitation to London’s [Prince Charles Cinema](https://www.instagram.com/p/CryUFoQIWmW/) is an offer that cannot be refused — especially for a viewing in 35mm.

_[Licorice Pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licorice_Pizza_%28store%29#:~:text=Licorice%20Pizza%20was%20a%20Los,the%20shape%20of%20a%20pizza.)_ is steeped in the orange-tinted nostalgia of 1970s Los Angeles. Starring Alana Haim of [Haim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjuA_o6Jzyo&ab_channel=HaimVEVO) (as Alana Kane), Cooper Hoffman (Gary Valentine) and his riff-raff group of friends, the narrative is a bunch of capers strung together that revolve around the relationship between Gary and Alana. Oh, and there’s a 10 year age gap between them: 15 and 25 respectively.

Alana is a part-time school photographer’s assistant and the only one of three offspring who doesn’t ‘have [her] shit together.’ She is teen angst and adolescent rage manifested in mid-twenties form. Hers is a case of arrested development; Gary, on the other hand, is wise beyond his 15 years. He’s a child actor who puts on the swagger of a 38 year-old showbiz tycoon. (Gary is a bar fly in a martini lounge and confidently takes Alana there on their first ‘date’.) The 10 years between them is crucial to their sparky dynamic, but stage of life is not an indicator of maturity. Their similar mindsets make them good companions — despite the age chasm. The proverbial elephant dictates that their connection would not be as wholesome if gender roles were reversed. But, again, that’s an argument based on double standards for why it works.

The world of _LP_ is a veritable pop-up book of 70s caricatures and celebrity cameos. In the _Pulp Fiction_ fashion, the movie is a sequence of bizarre vignettes; the joint experiences of which override the couple’s age difference and push them closer to one another. There’s a magnet between them but the invisible line of inappropriacy prevents a boundary from being crossed. Thus, the relationship maintains an innocence. Gary and Alana hang out in the brotherly-sisterly way, fight like an old married couple and deny unresolved tensions in the manner of _will-they-won’t-they_ rom-com protagonists. It’s strange on paper but comes together on screen — because of the chemistry between Hoffman and Haim. Even if they can’t be an item in the conventional sense, we hope they continue to orbit each other.

In the place of romantic connection — and steady employment — Gary and Alana become _serious_ business partners. Their entrepreneurship lends to selling water beds and pinball machines over the phone. It’s amusing for a while, until Alana decides to put aside childish pursuits and try on politics for size. The couple take diverging paths as they attempt to abide by the conventionalities of their respective age brackets. Eventually comes the realisation that ‘growing up’ is precisely about shrugging off ill-fitting familial and societal expectations.

Soundtrack-wise, director Paul Thomas Anderson understands the assignment and strives for extra credit. _LP_’s LP is a (moonage) daydream: [Bowie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZKqbPZ6tug&ab_channel=DavidBowie-Topic), [McCartney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxHgEu_o0lo&ab_channel=PaulMcCartney-Topic), [The Doors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lnoM25D-js&ab_channel=TheDoors-Topic), [Sonny & Cher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBtTyfPcuog&ab_channel=Sonny%26Cher-Topic); a Nina Simone [opener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1eoGz0v1oA&ab_channel=NinaSimone-Topic) that deserves special praise. Every scene has its song matched; a visual and sonic alignment on par with the ‘Across 110th Street’ [title sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gs1_ndm3r4&ab_channel=DouglasGarner) from _Jackie Brown_. Soundtracks are the glue that stick movies to memory. In _Licorice Pizza_, every needle drop, set piece, facial expression, one-liner and quirk is a mental souvenir. It’s a wonderful mish-mash of ingredients, thrown together with the heart-warming central relationship and summer vibrancy of 70s LA, that make _Pizza_ — not just a slice, but the whole pie.
