<p>
hello and welcome to my portfolio—
</p>
I'm zoë, a <a href="https://www.zoedowney.com/photography/">photographer</a> based near london, uk. I document the mundane and everyday ephemera that seek digital preservation. I also <a href="https://www.zoedowney.com/writing/">write</a> for my blog on cinema & contemporary media.
</p>
collected here are photo series I'm presently working on, along with film reviews & thought pieces.
</p>
I graduated from goldsmiths college, london in 2022 with my masters in american literature & culture—with a specialism in american and japanese animation. I hold a first-class bachelor's in english (goldsmiths, 2017).
