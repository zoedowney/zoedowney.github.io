imagery is <em>the</em> concern across my work, paired with the critical discourse that orbits it. in taking photos, my present focus is on minimalist details of still-life and subtler movements of street photography; scaling-down my approach and zeroing-in on the smaller—but significant—ordinary. my aim is to draw out instances of calm, serenity and visual order from the chaos of modern-day living.

view my project <a href="https://www.zoedowney.com/shoe-sighting/">'shoe sighting'</a> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/shoesighting">@shoesighting</a>), whereby I capture and curate photography that features footwear in beautiful or unusual ways. this work is inspired by my time at ual: london college of fashion where (in 2013) I spent a brief but experimental year studying to become a cordwainer.

my love for photography was sparked by my dad's interest in lomography and inheriting my grandmother's olympus om-1. this joy found in documentating image was later rekindled during a month-long trip to japan in 2019.
</p>
I earned my first-class bachelor's in english from goldsmiths, university of london in 2017. in 2020, I graduated with a master's in american literature & culture. I specialised in ecocriticism surrounding american and japanese animation.
