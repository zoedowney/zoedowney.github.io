my process, ongoing projects & features:
</p>
imagery is <em>the</em> concern across my work, paired with the critical discourse that orbits it. in taking photos, my present focus is on abstract details of still-life and subtler movements of street photography; scaling-down my approach and documenting the smaller—but significant—ordinary.
</p>
view my project <a href="https://www.zoedowney.com/shoe-sighting/">'shoe sighting'</a> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/shoesighting">@shoesighting</a>), whereby I capture and curate photography that features footwear in beautiful or unusual ways. this work is inspired by my time at ual: london college of fashion where—in 2013—I spent a brief but experimental year studying to become a cordwainer.

a short bio:
</p>
my love for photography was sparked by my dad's interest in lomography and film, and later rekindled during a trip to japan in 2019.
</p>
I earned my first-class <strong>bachelor's</strong> in english from goldsmiths, university in 2017. in 2020, I graduated with a <strong>master's</strong> in american literature & culture. I specialised in ecocriticism surrounding american and japanese animation.
