imagery is <em>the</em> concern across my work, paired with the critical discourse that orbits it. presently my focus is on abstract details of still-life and subtler movements of street photography; scaling-down my approach and documenting the smaller—but significant—ordinary.
</p>
ongoing projects & features:
</p>
view my project 'shoe sighting' (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/shoesighting">@shoesighting</a>), whereby I capture and curate photography that features footwear in beautiful or unusual ways. this work is inspired by my time at ual: london college of fashion where—in 2013—I spent a brief but experimental year studying to become a cordwainer.
